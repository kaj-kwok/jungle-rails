## Project Goals
* Become familiar with Ruby and the Rails framework
* Learn how to navigate an existing code-base
* Use existing code style and approach to implement new features in unfamiliar territory
* Apply previous learning tactics to research and become familiar with a new paradigm, language and framework
* A simulation of the real world where feature and bug-fix requests are listed instead of step-by-step instructions on how to implement a solution

## Setup

1. Run `bundle install` to install dependencies
2. Create `config/database.yml` by copying `config/database.example.yml`
3. Create `config/secrets.yml` by copying `config/secrets.example.yml`
4. Run `bin/rails db:reset` to create, load and seed db
5. Create .env file based on .env.example
6. Sign up for a Stripe account
7. Put Stripe (test) keys into appropriate .env vars
8. Run `bin/rails s -b 0.0.0.0` to start the server

## Database

If Rails is complaining about authentication to the database, uncomment the user and password fields from `config/database.yml` in the development and test sections, and replace if necessary the user and password `development` to an existing database user.
